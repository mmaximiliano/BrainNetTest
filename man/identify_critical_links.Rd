\title{Identify Critical Links in Graphs Between Populations}
\usage{
identify_critical_links(
  populations,
  alpha = 0.05,
  method = "fisher",
  adjust_method = "none",
  batch_size = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{populations}{A list of populations, each containing a list of graphs (adjacency matrices).}

\item{alpha}{The significance level for the hypothesis test. Default is 0.05.}

\item{method}{The statistical test method to use for edge comparison. Options are "fisher", "chi.squared", "prop".
Default is "fisher".}

\item{adjust_method}{The method for p-value adjustment for multiple testing. See ?p.adjust. Default is "none".}

\item{batch_size}{Number of edges to remove in each iteration. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
A list containing critical edges, edges removed, and modified populations.
}
\description{
This function identifies the critical links (edges) in graphs that contribute
to significant differences observed between populations in a hypothesis test.
It iteratively removes edges based on their statistical significance and
re-tests until the difference is no longer significant.
