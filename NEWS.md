# BrainNetTest 0.1.0

* Initial CRAN submission.
* Implements the L1-distance ANOVA test for populations of brain networks
  of Fraiman and Fraiman (2018) <doi:10.1038/s41598-018-21688-0>.
* Fast permutation procedure for identifying critical edges via a prefix-sum
  decomposition of the test statistic, reducing complexity from
  O(K * B * |E| * m) to O(B * |E| * m).
* Helpers to generate synthetic community-structured graphs and to visualise
  brain networks with communities.
