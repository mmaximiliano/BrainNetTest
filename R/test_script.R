# A simple test for the identify_critical_links function.
# This test aims to:
# 1) Generate two small "Control" and "Disease" populations with clearly different edge probabilities.
# 2) Run identify_critical_links() to see if it can detect any "critical" links that distinguish them.
# 3) Verify that the function returns the correct structure (a list) containing critical_edges,
#    edges_removed, and modified_populations.
# 4) We do not check for a specific number of critical edges hereâ€”just the structure
#    and a confirmed difference in edge probabilities between the two populations.
